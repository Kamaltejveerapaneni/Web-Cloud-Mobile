From there we will be directed to a repository page where we have to give a name to our repository
and description if available

Then we can either select our repositry to be either private or public and select radio box below(Initialize....)

Here i choose it to be public so any one with a link can view the repository

As shown below this is how we can create a new repositry succesfully

Now after a repository is created remotely we have to Clone Gitrepository to your local storage

Use Gitto add file into local,Modify files and use Gitto commit  change

Use Gitto push  the commit  to remote,Use Gitto pull (sync)  content with remote
